// BlueZ D-Bus GATT API description
// GATT local and remote services share the same high-level D-Bus API. Local
// refers to GATT based service exported by a BlueZ plugin or an external
// application. Remote refers to GATT services exported by the peer.
// BlueZ acts as a proxy, translating ATT operations to D-Bus method calls and
// Properties (or the opposite). Support for D-Bus Object Manager is mandatory for
// external services to allow seamless GATT declarations (Service, Characteristic
// and Descriptors) discovery. Each GATT service tree is required to export a D-Bus
// Object Manager at its root that is solely responsible for the objects that
// belong to that service.
// Releasing a registered GATT service is not defined yet. Any API extension
// should avoid breaking the defined API, and if possible keep an unified GATT
// remote and local services representation.
